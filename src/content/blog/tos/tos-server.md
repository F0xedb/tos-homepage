> TOS server is in a PRE-alpha stage. Installer may be buggy

TOS server is finally here. The custom linux version that fits all your needs. Tos is an operating system developed by Me (Tom Meyers).
It is actually a custom version build on top of arch linux. This version of linux has a bunch of features that make it better/easier to use than arch linux.

Previously you had only support for tos. Which is actually usable for your desktop needs. But now tos is aslo usable in a server environment.
Tos server edition is nothing more than a stript down version of tos. It features an installer that gives you everything needed to work in a server based environment. It ships with docker and docker-compose support for easy containerization. Now you may ask why should someone use tos server edition?
Here are a couple of reasons.

- low ram usage (under 150 MB)
- low cpu usage
- fast optimized kernel
- ships with docker and lxc for security.
- posibility to use custom installers for applications.
- ships with TOS cli. For all your server needs.
- Fast security patches.
- Much more.

TOS server is focused on using minimal system resources so that your applications can take the max out of your hardware without compromising security.

TOS server even protects it if an intruder enters the server room. This is done by using disk encryption and firewalls.

Overall TOS server is a stript down version of tos that doesn't compromise comfort for speed and security.

### What will be included when tos server gets its full release

- kubernetes support out of the box
- extended server tools to help you maintain your server/containers
- ability to setup basic server applications during install eg, webserver, ftp server, mail server etc
- custom provided community packages.
- And more

> More features will be included once the project matures.
